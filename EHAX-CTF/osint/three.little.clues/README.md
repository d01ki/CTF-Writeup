As a kid, I lived for the thrill of gaming, and my old, trusty PSP was my gateway to endless adventures. Nostalgia hit me hard recently, so I decided to order a similar handheld console to relive those golden days.

While placing the order, a news article caught my eye—a grand esports event, hosted by none other than the company behind the console I was buying. The event was held in a city towering with countless skyscrapers, their silhouettes piercing the heavens. Team **xyz** won the event

Curiosity led me further down the rabbit hole of the "Read More" section, where another article gripped my heart—a solemn piece mourning the death of a legendary former prime minister which happened during that time only.The Prime Minister was a great man who introduced various 'financial reforms' to his country. Three words flashed through my mind: Rest in Peace.
